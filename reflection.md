I learnt that paste function is a really useful function that allows me to combine two characters without space in between if I specify sep="". Another interesting new thing I learnt while researching the for loop online is that when we use for loop - such as, for (k in 0:10) - unlike the results returned which only features k from 1 to 10, the test is actually executed one time more than the loop body. Under this example, the for loop would also test k = 11 because in order to decide whether or not to execute k = 11, k = 11 must be tested. 

As a programmer, from developing this project, I grow to realize that in order to solve a complicated problem or to develop a function that solves this complicated problem, I should always start by solving the simplest version of the problem and develop my function as I add more complex conditions onto the simplest version. In this case, the simplest problem that my function should be able to solve is to find all possible combinations if I draw 2 elements from a list containing 3 element. So, I would first figure out this function. Then, I would build on top of this function in order to find combinations as I draw more elements from longer list. We can observe the intuition or pattern most clearly when the problem is less complicated. As a programmer, I also realized that when we build function, we usually take in variables of unknown values. If this unknown value defines how many times we need to loop, a while loop is usually needed to let the command runs until a certain condition is met and when the statement is proven to be false. 

My understanding of R changed as I realized that R is not only a good statistical tool for data modeling and analysis, it is also a powerful coding tool that allows me to perform and build complicated functions just like other programming languages.

During Div II, I made a minimally viable package for Div III with my teammates. It contains a dataset with NFT information that was scraped from Opensea. We spent most of our time developing scrape functions for Opensea as well as building the minimally viable package. One new thing I learnt is the CSS selectors which define patterns for locating HTML elements and are vital for scraping because they provide a concise way of describing which elements to extract.

As a programmer, along the way of developing this package, I grew to learn that even though usually there already exists a function that generally solves a particular kind of question, such as the scrape function (rvest) in this case, it is often too general and doesnâ€™t always work smoothly for all kinds of websites. As programmers, we can still add value by developing functions for very specific use if this usage is highly demanded by users such as those interested in analyzing and investing in NFT collections from Opensea. An explicit scrape function could save all those users tons of time while bringing them more interpretable information. 

My understanding of R changed as I realized that R is not only a useful statistical tool and a powerful programming language, but also a connected platform that grows to solve all kinds of problems for its users as each of us keep creating and elaborating functions, often building on top of each othersâ€™ functions.
