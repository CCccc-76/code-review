I think an r package that contains traffic datasests across the nation would be very useful since traffic usually reveal valuable information about environmental condition and city planning.  
And this dataset package should also makes the traffic data more accessible and straightforward by eliminating useless variables, transforming seemingly useless variables into useful variables, such as combining a complex set of timestamps to reveal transportation length, since the raw traffic statistics are usually very scattered and confusing. 

# Div II proposal

> Please describe the R package that you plan to develop for Div III. Is it a new package? Or is it a substantial revision of an existing package? What will it do? Why will it be useful? Who would use it? What features will it have?

Opensear is a new package that includes scrape functions that provide a simplified interface for Opensea API to be used in conjunction with the API key and the datasets scraped using the functions. It would be helpful for people who're interested in the information for specific NFT collections in Opensea and allows them to find the datasets they need in our package or quickly scrape that information from the website using our function with an API key. People who want to predict the trends of the values of different NFT collections and make investments will find our package very useful.

The package primarily features data cleaning procedures and additional data filtering capabilities in addition to the limited functionality of the OpenSea R package. This includes conversion for time series and filtering by activity for collections. Overall, this package will be used to create more accessible and functional data from Opensea.
